My name is Hilding Wollbo, I'm a graduate from KTH with a MSc in Information and Network Engineering and as BSc in Electrical Engineering. Currently looking for my first real job! 

I have a background in statistical signal processing, but my primary field of expertise is data science, machine learning, and applied information theory. I have been coding sporadically for 5 years in Python, and have also done a lot of signal processing/filtering in Matlab throughout my studies. 

This site is a place where I share my work and chronicle what I'm currently learning about, as well as other things that can be of interest to others in the space.
