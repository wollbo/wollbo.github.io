# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# IMPORTANT: The followign gem is used to compile math formulas to 
# KaTeX during site building.
#
# There are a couple of things to know about this gem:
# *  It is not supported on GitHub Pages. 
#    You have to build the site on your machine before uploading to GitHub,
#    or use a more permissive cloud building tool such as Netlify.
# *  You need some kind of JavaScript runtime on your machine.
#    Usually installing NodeJS will suffice. 
#    For details, see <https://github.com/kramdown/math-katex#documentation>
#
# If you're using the MathJax math engine instead, free to remove the line below:
